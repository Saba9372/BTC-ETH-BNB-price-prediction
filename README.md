# Overview

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB) have created a rapidly evolving financial market due to their decentralized and borderless nature. Traders and investors face high volatility and require effective tools to make informed decisions. This project introduces a hybrid model combining **Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks** to forecast next-day prices of BTC, ETH, and BNB. By automating technical analysis, the model helps reduce trading risk and supports data-driven decision-making for cryptocurrency market participants.
